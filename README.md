Common python practicals for high school level programming GIVE CREDITS ALWAYS GRRR


Hello :33 This note is to say that:
I created this to collect all the python programs I made in grade 11. These are a good study guide, do whatever you wish with them. But at least try to understand what the code is actually doing lolz.
Python is eazy peezy and my computer science teacher always tells us to think of the logic first before typing the code, so yeah...
Anyways
